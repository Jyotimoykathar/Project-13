## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Css
- Media queries

### Time required

Nearly 4 day required to complete and also get the desired responsiveness of the page.

### What I learned

This is the css design code snippet of the media querie at 704px.

```css
/* below 704px(Tablets) */
/* 704px/16 = 44 */
@media (max-width: 44em) {
  .heading-primary {
    font-size: 4.4rem;
  }
  .heading-secondary {
    font-size: 3rem;
    margin-bottom: 3.2rem;
  }
  .heading-tertiary {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
  .description {
    font-size: 1.4rem;
    line-height: 1;
  }
  .icon-mobile-nav {
    font-size: 3.6rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I still have a lot to improve on grid and media queries section.
